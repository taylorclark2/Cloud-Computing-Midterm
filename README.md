This project is a simple, cloud-based RESTful API designed to manage a collection of TV shows. This API provides a lightweight backend service with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. There is also a basic authentication using an API Key. The core data entity is a ‘Show’ object consisting of an ID, Title, Showrunner, Genre, Release Year, Number of Seasons, and Distributor attributes. This code uses C# on the .NET platform and deployed in the Azure Function App.
